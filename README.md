# tiramisu
1
Briskly whisk 3 egg yolks with the icing sugar until the mixture whitens and becomes frothy. Then add the mascarpone and mix until the result is homogeneous.
2
Whip 3 stiff egg whites by adding a pinch of salt, then mix them with the mascarpone cream. Be careful, to keep the mixture frothy and light, the whites must not be "broken". Mix gently from top to bottom with a silicone spatula, turning your container a quarter of a turn each time.
3
Brew a large cup of strong coffee, preferably an espresso. Add Amaretto, an Italian almond alcohol that will add an incredible flavor to your dessert, then mix.
4
Cut the ends of the cookies so that they adhere perfectly to the side of your dish. Use the ends to fill in the holes in the center of your tiramisu. Spread a layer of mascarpone cream on the bottom of the dish, then place a layer of cookies lightly soaked in Amaretto coffee.
